Basically a site to show projects I've made and skills I am competent with using.

# Features

- Home Page with navigation to other links.
- About page (\* self-indulgent page).
- A preview page that shows a few projects I've made with details about them.
- And a contact page with links so that people can get hold of me.

- Next.JS: A React framework that enables you to create full-stack web applications by extending the latest React features.
